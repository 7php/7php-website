# 7php Website
As of July 2017, I have decided to put some of my contents on github (copyrighted to 7PHP.COM) &amp; open up for contributions.

**7PHP** has been reloaded after its hiatus, read more at: [https://7php.com/v3/](https://7php.com/v3/)

So, as part of that new refreshed chapter, I'm going to try new things.

### BRANCH posts

- The branch **posts** will contain the articles as I do not want google to index them if they were on **master**

### License | Copyright

- All the contents in this repo and it's branches are **Copyrighted** to Khayrattee Wasseem of 7php.com
- Contributions & hence contributors will be acknowledged 

### Contact

- For any concern or query, please email me at: github@7php.com

## Your Contributions

- I need all my articles to be translated into French and {YOUR_LANGUAGE}. So I warmly welcome your help & contributions.
- Checkout the branch **posts** and submit your PRs.



#### I'M THANKFUL TO YOUR RESPONSES
